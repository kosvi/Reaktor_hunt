# Puzzle 3

## Plan

1) Read input data from a file line by line

2) Create a List where to store all known coordinates (start, finish, safe, wall etc.)

3) Create a matrix and insert all known coordinates to it

4) Use Dijkstra's algorithm to solve to route. If that algorithm can't solve it, create a game where use can move trough the route (use human intelligence when artificial fails :)

Sounds good! Happy coding to myself! I have never done anything like this, so let's see what comes out of this. 


Tried to study pathfinding from here:
